description: RecName: Full=Importin subunit alpha-3; AltName: Full=Importin alpha Q1; Short=Qip1; AltName: Full=Karyopherin subunit alpha-4;
FUNCTION: Functions in nuclear protein import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1. Binds specifically and directly to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran- dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. In vitro, mediates the nuclear import of human cytomegalovirus UL84 by recognizing a non- classical NLS.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}. Nucleus {ECO:0000250}.
TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in testis, ovary, small intestine, heart, skeletal muscle, lung and pancreas, but barely detectable in kidney, thymus, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes.
DOMAIN: Consists of an N-terminal hydrophilic region, a hydrophobic central region composed of 10 repeats, and a short hydrophilic C-terminus. The N-terminal hydrophilic region contains the importin beta binding domain (IBB domain), which is sufficient for binding importin beta and essential for nuclear protein import.
DOMAIN: The IBB domain is thought to act as an intrasteric autoregulatory sequence by interacting with the internal autoinhibitory NLS. Binding of KPNB1 probably overlaps the internal NLS and contributes to a high affinity for cytoplasmic NLS-containing cargo substrates. After dissociation of the importin/substrate complex in the nucleus the internal autohibitory NLS contributes to a low affinity for nuclear NLS- containing proteins (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
DOMAIN: The major and minor NLS binding sites are mainly involved in recognition of simple or bipartite NLS motifs. Structurally located within in a helical surface groove they contain several conserved Trp and Asn residues of the corresponding third helices (H3) of ARM repeats which mainly contribute to binding (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
SIMILARITY: Belongs to the importin alpha family. {ECO:0000305}.
CAUTION: Was termed importin alpha-3. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:9395085}.

FUNCTION: Functions in mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Mediates membrane fission through oligomerization into membrane- associated tubular structures that wrap around the scission site to constrict and sever the mitochondrial membrane through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. Through its function in mitochondrial division, ensures the survival of at least some types of postmitotic neurons, including Purkinje cells, by suppressing oxidative damage. Required for normal brain development, including that of cerebellum. Facilitates developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation. Required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis; this requirement may depend upon the cell type and the physiological apoptotic cues. Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:26992161). Required for formation of endocytic vesicles. Proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics through association with BCL2L1 isoform Bcl-X(L) which stimulates its GTPase activity in synaptic vesicles; the function may require its recruitment by MFF to clathrin-containing vesicles.

SUBUNIT: Homotetramer; dimerizes through the N-terminal GTP-middle region of one molecule binding to the GED domain of another DNM1L molecule. Oligomerizes in a GTP-dependent manner to form membrane- associated tubules with a spiral pattern. Can also oligomerize to form multimeric ring-like structures. Interacts with GSK3B and MARCH5. Interacts (via the GTPase and B domains) with UBE2I; the interaction promotes sumoylation of DNM1L, mainly in its B domain. Interacts with PPP3CA; the interaction dephosphorylates DNM1L and regulates its transition to mitochondria. Interacts with BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) and CLTA; DNM1L and BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) may form a complex in synaptic vesicles that also contains clathrin and MFF. Interacts with FIS1. Interacts with MIEF2 and MIEF1; this regulates GTP hydrolysis and DNM1L oligomerization. Interacts with PGAM5; this interaction leads to dephosphorylation at Ser-656 and activation of GTPase activity and eventually to mitochondria fragmentation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16874301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16936636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21508961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21701560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23530241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23584531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23792689, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23977156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27145208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200}.

Isoform 5 is dominantly expressed in liver, heart and kidney. Isoform 6 is expressed in neurons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9422767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9570752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9786947}.
DOMAIN: The GED domain folds back to interact, in cis, with the GTP-binding domain and middle domain, and interacts, in trans, with the GED domains of other DNM1L molecules, and is thus critical for activating GTPase activity and for DNM1L dimerization.
PTM: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on two sites near the GED domain regulate mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-637 inhibits the GTPase activity, leading to a defect in mitochondrial fission promoting mitochondrial elongation. Dephosphorylated on this site by PPP3CA which promotes mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-616 activates the GTPase activity and promotes mitochondrial fission. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17301055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26122121}.

FUNCTION: Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis (PubMed:17581632, PubMed:25849773, PubMed:27462815). The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre- initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF- 3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17581632, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25849773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27462815}.
SUBUNIT: Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is composed of 13 subunits: EIF3A, EIF3B, EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3E, EIF3F, EIF3G, EIF3H, EIF3I, EIF3J, EIF3K, EIF3L and EIF3M. The eIF-3 complex appears to include 3 stable modules: module A is composed of EIF3A, EIF3B, EIF3G and EIF3I; module B is composed of EIF3F, EIF3H, and EIF3M; and module C is composed of EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3E, EIF3K and EIF3L. EIF3C of module C binds EIF3B of module A and EIF3H of module B, thereby linking the three modules. EIF3J is a labile subunit that binds to the eIF-3 complex via EIF3B. The eIF-3 complex interacts with RPS6KB1 under conditions of nutrient depletion. Mitogenic stimulation leads to binding and activation of a complex composed of MTOR and RPTOR, leading to phosphorylation and release of RPS6KB1 and binding of EIF4B to eIF-3. Interacts with RNF139; the interaction leads to protein translation inhibitions in a ubiquitination- dependent manner. Interacts with DHX33; the interaction is independent of RNA (PubMed:26100019). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP- Rule:MF_03007, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16286006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16766523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17322308, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18599441, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20068067, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25849773, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26100019}.

FUNCTION: Functions in mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Mediates membrane fission through oligomerization into membrane- associated tubular structures that wrap around the scission site to constrict and sever the mitochondrial membrane through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. Through its function in mitochondrial division, ensures the survival of at least some types of postmitotic neurons, including Purkinje cells, by suppressing oxidative damage. Required for normal brain development, including that of cerebellum. Facilitates developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation. Required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis; this requirement may depend upon the cell type and the physiological apoptotic cues. Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:26992161). Required for formation of endocytic vesicles. Proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics through association with BCL2L1 isoform Bcl-X(L) which stimulates its GTPase activity in synaptic vesicles; the function may require its recruitment by MFF to clathrin-containing vesicles.

Interacts (via the GTPase and B domains) with UBE2I; the interaction promotes sumoylation of DNM1L, mainly in its B domain. Interacts with PPP3CA; the interaction dephosphorylates DNM1L and regulates its transition to mitochondria. Interacts with BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) and CLTA; DNM1L and BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) may form a complex in synaptic vesicles that also contains clathrin and MFF. Interacts with FIS1. Interacts with MIEF2 and MIEF1; this regulates GTP hydrolysis and DNM1L oligomerization.

Isoform 2 and isoform 3 are predominantly expressed in testis and skeletal muscles respectively. Isoform 4 is weakly expressed in brain, heart and kidney. Isoform 5 is dominantly expressed in liver, heart and kidney. Isoform 6 is expressed in neurons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9422767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9570752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9786947}.
DOMAIN: The GED domain folds back to interact, in cis, with the GTP-binding domain and middle domain, and interacts, in trans, with the GED domains of other DNM1L molecules, and is thus critical for activating GTPase activity and for DNM1L dimerization.
PTM: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on two sites near the GED domain regulate mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-637 inhibits the GTPase activity, leading to a defect in mitochondrial fission promoting mitochondrial elongation. Dephosphorylated on this site by PPP3CA which promotes mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-616 activates the GTPase activity and promotes mitochondrial fission. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17301055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26122121}.
PTM: Sumoylated on various lysine residues within the B domain, probably by MUL1. Sumoylation positively regulates mitochondrial fission. Desumoylated by SENP5 during G2/M transition of mitosis. Appears to be linked to its catalytic activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19407830, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19411255, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400}.
PTM: S-nitrosylation increases DNM1L dimerization, mitochondrial fission and causes neuronal damage. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19342591}.
PTM: Ubiquitination by MARCH5 affects mitochondrial morphology. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16874301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16936636}.
PTM: O-GlcNAcylation augments the level of the GTP-bound active form of DRP1 and induces translocation from the cytoplasm to mitochondria in cardiomyocytes. It also decreases phosphorylation at Ser-637 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
DISEASE: Note=May be associated with Alzheimer disease through amyloid-beta-induced increased S-nitrosylation of DNM1L, which triggers, directly or indirectly, excessive mitochondrial fission, synaptic loss and neuronal damage. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19342591}.
DISEASE: Encephalopathy due to defective mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission 1 (EMPF1) [MIM:614388]: A rare autosomal dominant systemic disorder resulting in lack of neurologic development and death in infancy. After birth, infants present in the first week of life with poor feeding and neurologic impairment, including hypotonia, little spontaneous movement, no tendon reflexes, no response to light stimulation, and poor visual fixation. Other features include mildly elevated plasma concentration of very-long-chain fatty acids, lactic acidosis, microcephaly, deep-set eyes, optic atrophy and hypoplasia, and an abnormal gyral pattern in both frontal lobes associated with dysmyelination. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17460227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26604000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26992161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27145208}.

FUNCTION: Functions in mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Mediates membrane fission through oligomerization into membrane- associated tubular structures that wrap around the scission site to constrict and sever the mitochondrial membrane through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. Through its function in mitochondrial division, ensures the survival of at least some types of postmitotic neurons, including Purkinje cells, by suppressing oxidative damage. Required for normal brain development, including that of cerebellum. Facilitates developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation. Required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis; this requirement may depend upon the cell type and the physiological apoptotic cues. Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:26992161). Required for formation of endocytic vesicles. Proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics through association with BCL2L1 isoform Bcl-X(L) which stimulates its GTPase activity in synaptic vesicles; the function may require its recruitment by MFF to clathrin-containing vesicles.

Oligomerizes in a GTP-dependent manner to form membrane- associated tubules with a spiral pattern. Can also oligomerize to form multimeric ring-like structures. Interacts with GSK3B and MARCH5. Interacts (via the GTPase and B domains) with UBE2I; the interaction promotes sumoylation of DNM1L, mainly in its B domain. Interacts with PPP3CA; the interaction dephosphorylates DNM1L and regulates its transition to mitochondria. Interacts with BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) and CLTA; DNM1L and BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) may form a complex in synaptic vesicles that also contains clathrin and MFF. Interacts with FIS1. Interacts with MIEF2 and MIEF1; this regulates GTP hydrolysis and DNM1L oligomerization. Interacts with PGAM5; this interaction leads to dephosphorylation at Ser-656 and activation of GTPase activity and eventually to mitochondria fragmentation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16874301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16936636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21508961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21701560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23530241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23584531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23792689, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23977156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27145208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200}.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed with highest levels found in skeletal muscles, heart, kidney and brain. Isoform 1 is brain-specific. Isoform 2 and isoform 3 are predominantly expressed in testis and skeletal muscles respectively. Isoform 4 is weakly expressed in brain, heart and kidney. Isoform 5 is dominantly expressed in liver, heart and kidney. Isoform 6 is expressed in neurons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9422767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9570752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9786947}.
DOMAIN: The GED domain folds back to interact, in cis, with the GTP-binding domain and middle domain, and interacts, in trans, with the GED domains of other DNM1L molecules, and is thus critical for activating GTPase activity and for DNM1L dimerization.
PTM: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on two sites near the GED domain regulate mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-637 inhibits the GTPase activity, leading to a defect in mitochondrial fission promoting mitochondrial elongation. Dephosphorylated on this site by PPP3CA which promotes mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-616 activates the GTPase activity and promotes mitochondrial fission. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17301055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26122121}.
PTM: Sumoylated on various lysine residues within the B domain, probably by MUL1. Sumoylation positively regulates mitochondrial fission. Desumoylated by SENP5 during G2/M transition of mitosis. Appears to be linked to its catalytic activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19407830, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19411255, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400}.

FUNCTION: Essential component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys- 9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. In the complex, RRP8 binds to H3K9me2 and probably acts as a methyltransferase. Its substrates are however unknown. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18485871}.

FUNCTION: Involved in the generation of internal asymmetric signals required for neuronal polarization and neurite outgrowth. Mediates netrin-1-induced F-actin-substrate coupling or 'clutch engagement' within the axon growth cone through activation of CDC42, RAC1 and PAK1-dependent signaling pathway, thereby converting the F-actin retrograde flow into traction forces, concomitantly with filopodium extension and axon outgrowth. Plays a role in cytoskeletal organization by regulating the subcellular localization of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity at the axonal growth cone. Plays also a role in regenerative neurite outgrowth. In the developing cortex, cooperates with KIF20B to promote both the transition from the multipolar to the bipolar stage and the radial migration of cortical neurons from the ventricular zone toward the superficial layer of the neocortex. Involved in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5- trisphosphate (PIP3) in the growth cone of primary hippocampal neurons. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A0MZ67, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8K2Q9}.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in striated muscles, specifically in type 2a fibers (at protein level). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20634291}.
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Induced by 2-fold during pregnancy, including in abdominus rectus muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20634291}.
DOMAIN: Heterotetramerization is mediated by the interaction between a coiled-coil of PRKG1 and the leucine/isoleucine zipper of PPP1R12A/MBS, the myosin-binding subunit of the myosin phosphatase. {ECO:0000250}.
DOMAIN: The KVKF motif mediates interaction with PPP1CB. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225}.
PTM: Phosphorylated by CIT (Rho-associated kinase) (By similarity). Phosphorylated cooperatively by ROCK1 and CDC42BP on Thr-696. Phosphorylated on upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR. In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA and PKG appears to prevent phosphorylation of the inhibitory site Thr-696, probably mediated by PRKG1. Phosphorylation at Ser-445, Ser-472 and Ser-910 by NUAK1 promotes interaction with 14-3-3, leading to inhibit interaction with myosin light chain MLC2, preventing dephosphorylation of MLC2. May be phosphorylated at Thr-696 by DMPK; may inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated at Ser-473 by CDK1 during mitosis, creating docking sites for the POLO box domains of PLK1. Subsequently, PLK1 binds and phosphorylates PPP1R12A. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10567269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11283607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11287000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11331307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12773565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15194681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15723050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17126281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18477460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19131646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19701943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19997641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21457715}.

FUNCTION: Lipid-binding protein that transports phosphatidylinositol, the precursor of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane (PubMed:28209843). It thereby maintains the pool of cell membrane phosphoinositides, which are degraded during phospholipase C (PLC) signaling (PubMed:28209843). Plays a key role in the coordination of Ca(2+) and phosphoinositide signaling: localizes to sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane, where it tethers the two bilayers (PubMed:28209843). In response to elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+), it is phosphorylated at its C- terminus and dissociates from the cell membrane, abolishing phosphatidylinositol transport to the cell membrane (PubMed:28209843). Positively regulates insulin secretion in response to glucose: phosphatidylinositol transfer to the cell membrane allows replenishment of PI(4,5)P2 pools and calcium channel opening, priming a new population of insulin granules (PubMed:28209843). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28209843}.

gene names: Name=HNRNPC; Synonyms=HNRPC;
description: RecName: Full=Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2; Short=hnRNP C1/C2;
FUNCTION: Binds pre-mRNA and nucleates the assembly of 40S hnRNP particles (PubMed:8264621). Interacts with poly-U tracts in the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR of mRNA and modulates the stability and the level of translation of bound mRNA molecules (PubMed:12509468, PubMed:16010978, PubMed:7567451, PubMed:8264621). Single HNRNPC tetramers bind 230-240 nucleotides. Trimers of HNRNPC tetramers bind 700 nucleotides (PubMed:8264621). May play a role in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. N6- methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to alter the local structure in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via a mechanism named 'm(6)A-switch', facilitating binding of HNRNPC, leading to regulation of mRNA splicing (PubMed:25719671). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16010978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25719671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7567451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8264621}.

Subsequently, expression becomes much stronger in the epithelium of the anterior part at 25 weeks and later. In retina, weakly expressed at 15 weeks in the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers (NFL and GCL). From 25 weeks onwards, much stronger expression is observed in the endfeet of Mueller cells, the NFL, and GCL, and much lower expression is observed in a minor subpopulation of cells in the inner cell layer (INL). At 30 and 36 weeks, expression remains in the neural retina, and subsequently becomes stronger in the NFL, GCL, and INL and is decreased in Mueller cells. At 36 weeks, also expressed at the external border of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (at protein level). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14552890}.

FUNCTION: Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF- kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. In addition to the NF-kappa-B inhibitors, phosphorylates several other components of the signaling pathway including NEMO/IKBKG, NF-kappa-B subunits RELA and NFKB1, as well as IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE. IKK-related kinase phosphorylations may prevent the overproduction of inflammatory mediators since they exert a negative regulation on canonical IKKs. Phosphorylates FOXO3, mediating the TNF- dependent inactivation of this pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Also phosphorylates other substrates including NCOA3, BCL10 and IRS1. Within the nucleus, acts as an adapter protein for NFKBIA degradation in UV-induced NF-kappa-B activation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11297557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17213322, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20410276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20434986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21138416}.

description: RecName: Full=Transcription elongation factor SPT5; Short=hSPT5; AltName: Full=DRB sensitivity-inducing factor 160 kDa subunit; Short=DSIF p160; AltName: Full=DRB sensitivity-inducing factor large subunit; Short=DSIF large subunit; AltName: Full=Tat-cotransactivator 1 protein; Short=Tat-CT1 protein;
FUNCTION: Component of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor complex (DSIF complex), which regulates mRNA processing and transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. DSIF positively regulates mRNA capping by stimulating the mRNA guanylyltransferase activity of RNGTT/CAP1A. DSIF also acts cooperatively with the negative elongation factor complex (NELF complex) to enhance transcriptional pausing at sites proximal to the promoter. Transcriptional pausing may facilitate the assembly of an elongation competent RNA polymerase II complex. DSIF and NELF promote pausing by inhibition of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS/S-II. TFIIS/S-II binds to RNA polymerase II at transcription pause sites and stimulates the weak intrinsic nuclease activity of the enzyme. Cleavage of blocked transcripts by RNA polymerase II promotes the resumption of transcription from the new 3' terminus and may allow repeated attempts at transcription through natural pause sites. DSIF can also positively regulate transcriptional elongation and is required for the efficient activation of transcriptional elongation by the HIV- 1 nuclear transcriptional activator, Tat. DSIF acts to suppress transcriptional pausing in transcripts derived from the HIV-1 LTR and blocks premature release of HIV-1 transcripts at terminator sequences. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10075709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10199401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10393184, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10421630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10454543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10757782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10912001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11112772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11553615, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12653964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14701750, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15136722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15380072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214896, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9450929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9514752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9857195}.
SUBUNIT: Interacts with SUPT4H1 to form DSIF. DSIF interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b complex (P-TEFb complex), which is composed of CDK9 and cyclin-T (CCNT1 or CCNT2). DSIF interacts with RNA polymerase II, and this interaction is reduced by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of POLR2A by P-TEFb. DSIF also interacts with the NELF complex, which is composed of WHSC2/NELFA, COBRA1/NELFB, TH1L/NELFD and RDBP/NELFE, and this interaction occurs following prior binding of DSIF to RNA polymerase II. DSIF also interacts with PRMT1/HRMT1L2, HTATSF1/TATSF1, RNGTT/CAP1A, PRMT5/SKB1, SUPT6H, and can interact with PIN1.

DOMAIN: The coiled coil domain is necessary for the homodimerization.
MISCELLANEOUS: May serve as a prognostic marker for cancers such as adenocarcinomas of the lung and breast cancers. It is present and overexpressed in many patients suffering from breast carcinomas, its level of expression correlates with tumor grade, suggesting that it may be involved in cancer immune escape. According to PubMed:12672804, it is however not directly a tumor- associated antigen, but it rather modulates surface expression of tumor-associated O-linked glycan Tn when it is overexpressed, suggesting that it contributes indirectly to the antigenicity of tumor cells.
CAUTION: It was initially reported to be a ligand for some putative receptor present on T-, B-, natural killer (NK) cells and various human cell lines. However, PubMed:12672804 showed that it does not bind any receptor. {ECO:0000305}.

description: RecName: Full=Period circadian protein homolog 1; Short=hPER1; AltName: Full=Circadian clock protein PERIOD 1; AltName: Full=Circadian pacemaker protein Rigui;
FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time- keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genes expression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be required for the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 protein decay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTL target genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA in liver. Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadian clock, has an important function in the regulation of several processes. Participates in the repression of glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) by ARNTL:CLOCK. Plays a role in the modulation of the neuroinflammatory state via the regulation of inflammatory mediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In spinal astrocytes, negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK MAPK cascades as well as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Coordinately regulates the expression of multiple genes that are involved in the regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as gene expression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, in kidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration with CLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling. Represses the CLOCK- ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054}.

DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Induced by 2-fold during pregnancy, including in abdominus rectus muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20634291}.
DOMAIN: Heterotetramerization is mediated by the interaction between a coiled-coil of PRKG1 and the leucine/isoleucine zipper of PPP1R12A/MBS, the myosin-binding subunit of the myosin phosphatase. {ECO:0000250}.
DOMAIN: The KVKF motif mediates interaction with PPP1CB. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225}.
PTM: Phosphorylated by CIT (Rho-associated kinase) (By similarity). Phosphorylated cooperatively by ROCK1 and CDC42BP on Thr-696. Phosphorylated on upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR. In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA and PKG appears to prevent phosphorylation of the inhibitory site Thr-696, probably mediated by PRKG1. Phosphorylation at Ser-445, Ser-472 and Ser-910 by NUAK1 promotes interaction with 14-3-3, leading to inhibit interaction with myosin light chain MLC2, preventing dephosphorylation of MLC2. May be phosphorylated at Thr-696 by DMPK; may inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated at Ser-473 by CDK1 during mitosis, creating docking sites for the POLO box domains of PLK1.

FUNCTION: Threonine kinase that regulates protein synthesis by controlling the rate of peptide chain elongation. Upon activation by a variety of upstream kinases including AMPK or TRPM7, phosphorylates the elongation factor EEF2 at a single site, renders it unable to bind ribosomes and thus inactive. In turn, the rate of protein synthesis is reduced. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14709557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9144159}.

PTM: Autophosphorylated at multiple residues, Thr-348 being the major site. Phosphorylated by AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK at Ser-398 leading to EEF2K activation and protein synthesis inhibition. Phosphorylated by TRPM7 at Ser-78 resulting in improved protein stability, higher EE2F phosphorylated and subsequently reduced rate of protein synthesis. Phosphorylation by other kinases such as CDK1 and MAPK13 at Ser-359 or RPS6KA1 and RPS6KB1 at Ser-366 instead decrease EEF2K activity and promote protein synthesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11015200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11500363, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11500364, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14709557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18337751, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21112387, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22216903}.

description: RecName: Full=3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; Short=hPDK1; EC=2.7.11.1;
FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as a master kinase, phosphorylating and activating a subgroup of the AGC family of protein kinases. Its targets include: protein kinase B (PKB/AKT1, PKB/AKT2, PKB/AKT3), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2 and RPS6KA3), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACA), protein kinase C (PRKCD and PRKCZ), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3), p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), protein kinase PKN (PKN1 and PKN2). Plays a central role in the transduction of signals from insulin by providing the activating phosphorylation to PKB/AKT1, thus propagating the signal to downstream targets controlling cell proliferation and survival, as well as glucose and amino acid uptake and storage. Negatively regulates the TGF-beta-induced signaling by: modulating the association of SMAD3 and SMAD7 with TGF-beta receptor, phosphorylating SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7, preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and the translocation of SMAD7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Activates PPARG transcriptional activity and promotes adipocyte differentiation. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via phosphorylation of IKKB. The tyrosine phosphorylated form is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesions by angiotensin II. Controls proliferation, survival, and growth of developing pancreatic cells. Participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of mast cells. Essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response. Plays an important role during thymocyte development by regulating the expression of key nutrient receptors on the surface of pre-T cells and mediating Notch-induced cell growth and proliferative responses. Provides negative feedback inhibition to toll-like receptor-mediated NF- kappa-B activation in macrophages. Isoform 3 is catalytically inactive. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12167717, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17371830, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18835241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9094314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9445476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9707564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768361}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
ENZYME REGULATION: Homodimerization regulates its activity by maintaining the kinase in an autoinhibitory conformation. NPRL2 down-regulates its activity by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation at the Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 residues. The 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ acts as a negative regulator by association with the residues surrounding the Ser-241 residue. STRAP positively regulates its activity by enhancing its autophosphorylation and by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7 also positively regulate its activity by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. Activated by phosphorylation on Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer in its autoinhibited state. Active as monomer. Interacts with NPRL2, PPARG, PAK1, PTK2B, GRB14, PKN1 (via C- terminus), STRAP and IKKB.

The tyrosine- phosphorylated form interacts with PTPN6. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form interacts with YWHAH and YWHAQ. Binds INSR in response to insulin. Interacts (via PH domain) with SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7. Interacts with PKN2; the interaction stimulates PDPK1 autophosphorylation, its PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase activity toward 'Ser-473' of AKT1 but also activates its kinase activity toward PRKCD and PRKCZ. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15210700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19591923, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Cell membrane; Peripheral membrane protein. Cell junction, focal adhesion. Note=Tyrosine phosphorylation seems to occur only at the cell membrane. Translocates to the cell membrane following insulin stimulation by a mechanism that involves binding to GRB14 and INSR. SRC and HSP90 promote its localization to the cell membrane. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with PTPN6 and its phosphorylation at Ser-396. Restricted to the nucleus in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in the cytoplasm. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form is distributed along the perinuclear region in neuronal cells while in non- neuronal cells it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. IGF1 transiently increases phosphorylation at Ser-241 of neuronal PDPK1, resulting in its translocation to other cellular compartments. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form colocalizes with PTK2B in focal adhesions after angiotensin II stimulation.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Appears to be expressed ubiquitously. The Tyr- 9 phosphorylated form is markedly increased in diseased tissue compared with normal tissue from lung, liver, colon and breast. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423}.
INDUCTION: Stimulated by insulin, and the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and peroxovanadate.
DOMAIN: The PH domain plays a pivotal role in the localization and nuclear import of PDPK1 and is also essential for its homodimerization.
DOMAIN: The PIF-pocket is a small lobe in the catalytic domain required by the enzyme for the binding to the hydrophobic motif of its substrates. It is an allosteric regulatory site that can accommodate small compounds acting as allosteric inhibitors. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22999883}.
PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-241 in the activation loop is required for full activity. PDPK1 itself can autophosphorylate Ser-241, leading to its own activation. Autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2 (By similarity). Tyr-9 phosphorylation is critical for stabilization of both PDPK1 and the PDPK1/SRC complex via HSP90-mediated protection of PDPK1 degradation. Angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDPK1 in vascular smooth muscle in a calcium- and SRC-dependent manner. Phosphorylated on Tyr-9, Tyr- 373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. Palmitate negatively regulates autophosphorylation at Ser-241 and palmitate- induced phosphorylation at Ser-529 and Ser-501 by PKC/PRKCQ negatively regulates its ability to phosphorylate PKB/AKT1. Phosphorylation at Thr-354 by MELK partially inhibits kinase activity, the inhibition is cooperatively enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser-394 and Ser-398 by MAP3K5. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10455013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11481331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15743829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16780920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22544756, ECO:0000269|Ref.8}.

Negatively regulates the TGF-beta-induced signaling by: modulating the association of SMAD3 and SMAD7 with TGF-beta receptor, phosphorylating SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7, preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and the translocation of SMAD7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Activates PPARG transcriptional activity and promotes adipocyte differentiation. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via phosphorylation of IKKB. The tyrosine phosphorylated form is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesions by angiotensin II. Controls proliferation, survival, and growth of developing pancreatic cells. Participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of mast cells. Essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response. Plays an important role during thymocyte development by regulating the expression of key nutrient receptors on the surface of pre-T cells and mediating Notch-induced cell growth and proliferative responses. Provides negative feedback inhibition to toll-like receptor-mediated NF- kappa-B activation in macrophages. Isoform 3 is catalytically inactive. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12167717, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17371830, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18835241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9094314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9445476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9707564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768361}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
ENZYME REGULATION: Homodimerization regulates its activity by maintaining the kinase in an autoinhibitory conformation. NPRL2 down-regulates its activity by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation at the Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 residues. The 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ acts as a negative regulator by association with the residues surrounding the Ser-241 residue. STRAP positively regulates its activity by enhancing its autophosphorylation and by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7 also positively regulate its activity by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. Activated by phosphorylation on Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer in its autoinhibited state. Active as monomer. Interacts with NPRL2, PPARG, PAK1, PTK2B, GRB14, PKN1 (via C- terminus), STRAP and IKKB. The Tyr-9 phosphorylated form interacts with SRC, RASA1 and CRK (via their SH2 domains). Interacts with SGK3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The tyrosine- phosphorylated form interacts with PTPN6. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form interacts with YWHAH and YWHAQ. Binds INSR in response to insulin. Interacts (via PH domain) with SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7. Interacts with PKN2; the interaction stimulates PDPK1 autophosphorylation, its PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase activity toward 'Ser-473' of AKT1 but also activates its kinase activity toward PRKCD and PRKCZ. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15210700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19591923, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Cell membrane; Peripheral membrane protein. Cell junction, focal adhesion. Note=Tyrosine phosphorylation seems to occur only at the cell membrane. Translocates to the cell membrane following insulin stimulation by a mechanism that involves binding to GRB14 and INSR. SRC and HSP90 promote its localization to the cell membrane. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with PTPN6 and its phosphorylation at Ser-396. Restricted to the nucleus in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in the cytoplasm. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form is distributed along the perinuclear region in neuronal cells while in non- neuronal cells it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. IGF1 transiently increases phosphorylation at Ser-241 of neuronal PDPK1, resulting in its translocation to other cellular compartments. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form colocalizes with PTK2B in focal adhesions after angiotensin II stimulation.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Appears to be expressed ubiquitously. The Tyr- 9 phosphorylated form is markedly increased in diseased tissue compared with normal tissue from lung, liver, colon and breast. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423}.
INDUCTION: Stimulated by insulin, and the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and peroxovanadate.
DOMAIN: The PH domain plays a pivotal role in the localization and nuclear import of PDPK1 and is also essential for its homodimerization.
DOMAIN: The PIF-pocket is a small lobe in the catalytic domain required by the enzyme for the binding to the hydrophobic motif of its substrates. It is an allosteric regulatory site that can accommodate small compounds acting as allosteric inhibitors. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22999883}.
PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-241 in the activation loop is required for full activity. PDPK1 itself can autophosphorylate Ser-241, leading to its own activation. Autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2 (By similarity). Tyr-9 phosphorylation is critical for stabilization of both PDPK1 and the PDPK1/SRC complex via HSP90-mediated protection of PDPK1 degradation. Angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDPK1 in vascular smooth muscle in a calcium- and SRC-dependent manner. Phosphorylated on Tyr-9, Tyr- 373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. Palmitate negatively regulates autophosphorylation at Ser-241 and palmitate- induced phosphorylation at Ser-529 and Ser-501 by PKC/PRKCQ negatively regulates its ability to phosphorylate PKB/AKT1. Phosphorylation at Thr-354 by MELK partially inhibits kinase activity, the inhibition is cooperatively enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser-394 and Ser-398 by MAP3K5. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10455013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11481331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15743829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16780920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22544756, ECO:0000269|Ref.8}.

FUNCTION: Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphatase that specifically hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol- 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) to produce PtdIns(3,4)P2, thereby negatively regulating the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathways. Plays a central role in regulation of PI3K-dependent insulin signaling, although the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain unclear. While overexpression reduces both insulin-stimulated MAP kinase and Akt activation, its absence does not affect insulin signaling or GLUT4 trafficking. Confers resistance to dietary obesity. May act by regulating AKT2, but not AKT1, phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Part of a signaling pathway that regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Required for the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of actin structures as well as in endocytosis, having a major impact on ligand-induced EGFR internalization and degradation. Participates in regulation of cortical and submembraneous actin by hydrolyzing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 thereby regulating membrane ruffling (PubMed:21624956). Regulates cell adhesion and cell spreading. Required for HGF-mediated lamellipodium formation, cell scattering and spreading. Acts as a negative regulator of EPHA2 receptor endocytosis by inhibiting via PI3K-dependent Rac1 activation. Acts as a regulator of neuritogenesis by regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 level and is required to form an initial protrusive pattern, and later, maintain proper neurite outgrowth. Acts as a negative regulator of the FC-gamma- RIIA receptor (FCGR2A). Mediates signaling from the FC-gamma-RIIB receptor (FCGR2B), playing a central role in terminating signal transduction from activating immune/hematopoietic cell receptor systems. Involved in EGF signaling pathway. Upon stimulation by EGF, it is recruited by EGFR and dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Plays a negative role in regulating the PI3K-PKB pathway, possibly by inhibiting PKB activity. Down-regulates Fc-gamma-R-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages independently of INPP5D/SHIP1. In macrophages, down-regulates NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription by regulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced signaling. May also hydrolyze PtdIns(1,3,4,5)P4, and could thus affect the levels of the higher inositol polyphosphates like InsP6. Involved in endochondral ossification. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11349134, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11739414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12235291, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12676785, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12690104, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15668240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17135240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21624956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23273569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9660833}.

FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as a master kinase, phosphorylating and activating a subgroup of the AGC family of protein kinases. Its targets include: protein kinase B (PKB/AKT1, PKB/AKT2, PKB/AKT3), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2 and RPS6KA3), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACA), protein kinase C (PRKCD and PRKCZ), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3), p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), protein kinase PKN (PKN1 and PKN2). Plays a central role in the transduction of signals from insulin by providing the activating phosphorylation to PKB/AKT1, thus propagating the signal to downstream targets controlling cell proliferation and survival, as well as glucose and amino acid uptake and storage. Negatively regulates the TGF-beta-induced signaling by: modulating the association of SMAD3 and SMAD7 with TGF-beta receptor, phosphorylating SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7, preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and the translocation of SMAD7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Activates PPARG transcriptional activity and promotes adipocyte differentiation. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via phosphorylation of IKKB. The tyrosine phosphorylated form is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesions by angiotensin II. Controls proliferation, survival, and growth of developing pancreatic cells. Participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of mast cells. Essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response. Plays an important role during thymocyte development by regulating the expression of key nutrient receptors on the surface of pre-T cells and mediating Notch-induced cell growth and proliferative responses. Provides negative feedback inhibition to toll-like receptor-mediated NF- kappa-B activation in macrophages. Isoform 3 is catalytically inactive. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12167717, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17371830, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18835241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9094314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9445476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9707564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768361}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
ENZYME REGULATION: Homodimerization regulates its activity by maintaining the kinase in an autoinhibitory conformation. NPRL2 down-regulates its activity by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation at the Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 residues. The 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ acts as a negative regulator by association with the residues surrounding the Ser-241 residue. STRAP positively regulates its activity by enhancing its autophosphorylation and by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7 also positively regulate its activity by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. Activated by phosphorylation on Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer in its autoinhibited state. Active as monomer. Interacts with NPRL2, PPARG, PAK1, PTK2B, GRB14, PKN1 (via C- terminus), STRAP and IKKB. The Tyr-9 phosphorylated form interacts with SRC, RASA1 and CRK (via their SH2 domains). Interacts with SGK3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The tyrosine- phosphorylated form interacts with PTPN6. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form interacts with YWHAH and YWHAQ. Binds INSR in response to insulin. Interacts (via PH domain) with SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7. Interacts with PKN2; the interaction stimulates PDPK1 autophosphorylation, its PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase activity toward 'Ser-473' of AKT1 but also activates its kinase activity toward PRKCD and PRKCZ. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15210700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19591923, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Cell membrane; Peripheral membrane protein. Cell junction, focal adhesion. Note=Tyrosine phosphorylation seems to occur only at the cell membrane. Translocates to the cell membrane following insulin stimulation by a mechanism that involves binding to GRB14 and INSR. SRC and HSP90 promote its localization to the cell membrane. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with PTPN6 and its phosphorylation at Ser-396. Restricted to the nucleus in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in the cytoplasm. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form is distributed along the perinuclear region in neuronal cells while in non- neuronal cells it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. IGF1 transiently increases phosphorylation at Ser-241 of neuronal PDPK1, resulting in its translocation to other cellular compartments. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form colocalizes with PTK2B in focal adhesions after angiotensin II stimulation.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Appears to be expressed ubiquitously. The Tyr- 9 phosphorylated form is markedly increased in diseased tissue compared with normal tissue from lung, liver, colon and breast. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423}.
INDUCTION: Stimulated by insulin, and the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and peroxovanadate.
DOMAIN: The PH domain plays a pivotal role in the localization and nuclear import of PDPK1 and is also essential for its homodimerization.
DOMAIN: The PIF-pocket is a small lobe in the catalytic domain required by the enzyme for the binding to the hydrophobic motif of its substrates. It is an allosteric regulatory site that can accommodate small compounds acting as allosteric inhibitors. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22999883}.
PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-241 in the activation loop is required for full activity. PDPK1 itself can autophosphorylate Ser-241, leading to its own activation. Autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2 (By similarity). Tyr-9 phosphorylation is critical for stabilization of both PDPK1 and the PDPK1/SRC complex via HSP90-mediated protection of PDPK1 degradation. Angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDPK1 in vascular smooth muscle in a calcium- and SRC-dependent manner. Phosphorylated on Tyr-9, Tyr- 373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. Palmitate negatively regulates autophosphorylation at Ser-241 and palmitate- induced phosphorylation at Ser-529 and Ser-501 by PKC/PRKCQ negatively regulates its ability to phosphorylate PKB/AKT1. Phosphorylation at Thr-354 by MELK partially inhibits kinase activity, the inhibition is cooperatively enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser-394 and Ser-398 by MAP3K5. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10455013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11481331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15743829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16780920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22544756, ECO:0000269|Ref.8}.

FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Binds DNA non-specifically. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2BH40, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12672490, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.

description: RecName: Full=Proteasome subunit alpha type-7; EC=3.4.25.1 {ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742}; AltName: Full=Proteasome subunit RC6-1; AltName: Full=Proteasome subunit XAPC7;
FUNCTION: Component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins. This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Inhibits the transactivation function of HIF- 1A under both normoxic and hypoxia-mimicking conditions. The interaction with EMAP2 increases the proteasome-mediated HIF-1A degradation under the hypoxic conditions. Plays a role in hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Mediates nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR) and thereby enhances androgen-mediated transactivation. Promotes MAVS degradation and thereby negatively regulates MAVS-mediated innate immune response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11389899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11713272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12119296, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15244466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19442227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19734229, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8610016}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: Cleavage of peptide bonds with very broad specificity. {ECO:0000255|PROSITE-ProRule:PRU00808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742}.
SUBUNIT: The 26S proteasome consists of a 20S proteasome core and two 19S regulatory subunits. The 20S proteasome core is a barrel- shaped complex made of 28 subunits that are arranged in four stacked rings. The two outer rings are each formed by seven alpha subunits, and the two inner rings are formed by seven beta subunits. The proteolytic activity is exerted by three beta- subunits PSMB5, PSMB6 and PSMB7. PSMA7 interacts directly with the PSMG1-PSMG2 heterodimer which promotes 20S proteasome assembly (PubMed:16251969).

FUNCTION: Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K4/MKK4, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4/MKK4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The monophosphorylation of JNKs on the Thr residue is sufficient to increase JNK activity indicating that MAP2K7/MKK7 is important to trigger JNK activity, while the additional phosphorylation of the Tyr residue by MAP2K4/MKK4 ensures optimal JNK activation. Has a specific role in JNK signal transduction pathway activated by proinflammatory cytokines. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9312068, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9372971, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9535930, ECO:0000269|Ref.5}.

description: RecName: Full=Period circadian protein homolog 1; Short=hPER1; AltName: Full=Circadian clock protein PERIOD 1; AltName: Full=Circadian pacemaker protein Rigui;
FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time- keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Regulates circadian target genes expression at post-transcriptional levels, but may not be required for the repression at transcriptional level. Controls PER2 protein decay. Represses CRY2 preventing its repression on CLOCK/ARNTL target genes such as FXYD5 and SCNN1A in kidney and PPARA in liver. Besides its involvement in the maintenance of the circadian clock, has an important function in the regulation of several processes. Participates in the repression of glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1/GR-induced transcriptional activity by reducing the association of NR3C1/GR to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) by ARNTL:CLOCK. Plays a role in the modulation of the neuroinflammatory state via the regulation of inflammatory mediators release, such as CCL2 and IL6. In spinal astrocytes, negatively regulates the MAPK14/p38 and MAPK8/JNK MAPK cascades as well as the subsequent activation of NFkappaB. Coordinately regulates the expression of multiple genes that are involved in the regulation of renal sodium reabsorption. Can act as gene expression activator in a gene and tissue specific manner, in kidney enhances WNK1 and SLC12A3 expression in collaboration with CLOCK. Modulates hair follicle cycling. Represses the CLOCK- ARNTL/BMAL1 induced transcription of BHLHE40/DEC1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24005054}.

FG repeats are interaction sites for karyopherins (importins, exportins) and form probably an affinity gradient, guiding the transport proteins unidirectionally with their cargo through the NPC. FG repeat regions are highly flexible and lack ordered secondary structure. The overall conservation of FG repeats regarding exact sequence, spacing, and repeat unit length is limited. {ECO:0000305}.

Mutations in the RANBP2 gene predispose to IIAE3, but by themselves are insufficient to make the phenotype fully penetrant; additional genetic and environmental factors are required (PubMed:19118815). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19118815}.
SIMILARITY: Belongs to the RanBP2 E3 ligase family. {ECO:0000305}.

description: RecName: Full=Serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1; EC=2.7.11.1; AltName: Full=Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1;
FUNCTION: Serine/threonine-protein kinase which is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of ion channels, membrane transporters, cellular enzymes, transcription factors, neuronal excitability, cell growth, proliferation, survival, migration and apoptosis. Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
ENZYME REGULATION: Two specific sites, one in the kinase domain (Thr-256) and the other in the C-terminal regulatory region (Ser- 422), need to be phosphorylated for its full activation.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Cell membrane. Mitochondrion. Note=The subcellular localization is controlled by the cell cycle, as well as by exposure to specific hormones and environmental stress stimuli. In proliferating cells, it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in synchrony with the cell cycle, and in serum/growth factor- stimulated cells it resides in the nucleus. In contrast, after exposure to environmental stress or treatment with glucocorticoids, it is detected in the cytoplasm and with certain stress conditions is associated with the mitochondria. In osmoregulation through the epithelial sodium channel, it can be localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Nuclear, upon phosphorylation.
SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Isoform 2: Cell membrane.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in most tissues with highest levels in the pancreas, followed by placenta, kidney and lung. Isoform 2 is strongly expressed in brain and pancreas, weaker in heart, placenta, lung, liver and skeletal muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10548550, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
INDUCTION: Induced by a very large spectrum of stimuli distinct from glucocorticoids and serum. These include aldosterone, cell shrinkage, cell swelling, TGF-beta, ischemic injury of the brain, neuronal excitotoxicity memory consolidation, chronic viral hepatitis, DNA-damaging agents, vitamin D3 psychophysiological stress, iron, glucose, EDN1, CSF2, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbolesters, follicle- stimulating hormone, sorbitol, heat shock, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and p53/TP53. Many of these stimuli are highly cell- specific, as is the case, for example for aldosterone, which has been found to stimulate its expression only in cells derived from aldosterone-responsive epithelia. Isoform 2 is not induced by glucocorticoids but by excessive extracellular glucose and by TGFB1, in cultured cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
DOMAIN: Isoform 2 subcellular localization at the cell membrane and resistance to proteasomal degradation is mediated by the sequences within the first 120 amino acids.
PTM: Regulated by phosphorylation. Activated by phosphorylation on Ser-422 by mTORC2, transforming it into a substrate for PDPK1 which phosphorylates it on Thr-256. Phosphorylation on Ser-397 and Ser-401 are also essential for its activity. Phosphorylation on Ser-78 by MAPK7 is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10191262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11096081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11254654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18925875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19068477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20338997}.
PTM: Ubiquitinated by NEDD4L; which promotes proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated by SYVN1 at the endoplasmic reticulum; which promotes rapid proteasomal degradation and maintains a high turnover rate in resting cells. Isoform 2 shows enhanced stability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576372}.

The majority of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is thought to occur via type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases given the abundance of PtdIns4P. Participates in a variety of cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, migration and phagocytosis. Required for membrane ruffling formation, actin organization and focal adhesion formation during directional cell migration by controlling integrin-induced translocation of RAC1 to the plasma membrane. Together with PIP5K1C is required for phagocytosis, but they regulate different types of actin remodeling at sequential steps. Promotes particle ingestion by activating WAS that induces Arp2/3 dependent actin polymerization at the nascent phagocytic cup. Together with PIP5K1B is required after stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors for stable platelet adhesion. Plays a role during calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Recruited to the plasma membrane by the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex where it provides the substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2 for the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that mobilize internal calcium and drive keratinocyte differentiation. Together with PIP5K1C have a role during embryogenesis.

FUNCTION: Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF- kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. In addition to the NF-kappa-B inhibitors, phosphorylates several other components of the signaling pathway including NEMO/IKBKG, NF-kappa-B subunits RELA and NFKB1, as well as IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE. IKK-related kinase phosphorylations may prevent the overproduction of inflammatory mediators since they exert a negative regulation on canonical IKKs. Phosphorylates FOXO3, mediating the TNF- dependent inactivation of this pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Also phosphorylates other substrates including NCOA3, BCL10 and IRS1. Within the nucleus, acts as an adapter protein for NFKBIA degradation in UV-induced NF-kappa-B activation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11297557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17213322, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20410276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20434986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21138416}.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly expressed in heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis and peripheral blood.
DOMAIN: The kinase domain is located in the N-terminal region. The leucine zipper is important to allow homo- and hetero- dimerization. At the C-terminal region is located the region responsible for the interaction with NEMO/IKBKG. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18626576}.

FUNCTION: Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF- kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses. Acts as part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues. These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis. In addition to the NF-kappa-B inhibitors, phosphorylates several other components of the signaling pathway including NEMO/IKBKG, NF-kappa-B subunits RELA and NFKB1, as well as IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE. IKK-related kinase phosphorylations may prevent the overproduction of inflammatory mediators since they exert a negative regulation on canonical IKKs. Phosphorylates FOXO3, mediating the TNF- dependent inactivation of this pro-apoptotic transcription factor. Also phosphorylates other substrates including NCOA3, BCL10 and IRS1. Within the nucleus, acts as an adapter protein for NFKBIA degradation in UV-induced NF-kappa-B activation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11297557, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17213322, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19716809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20410276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20434986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20797629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21138416}.

FUNCTION: The coatomer is a cytosolic protein complex that binds to dilysine motifs and reversibly associates with Golgi non- clathrin-coated vesicles, which further mediate biosynthetic protein transport from the ER, via the Golgi up to the trans Golgi network. The coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. In mammals, the coatomer can only be recruited by membranes associated with ADP- ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small GTP-binding proteins; the complex also influences the Golgi structural integrity, as well as the processing, activity, and endocytic recycling of LDL receptors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

gene names: Name=DDX3X; Synonyms=DBX, DDX3;
description: RecName: Full=ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X; EC=3.6.4.13; AltName: Full=DEAD box protein 3, X-chromosomal; AltName: Full=DEAD box, X isoform; AltName: Full=Helicase-like protein 2; Short=HLP2;
FUNCTION: Multifunctional ATP-dependent RNA helicase. The ATPase activity can be stimulated by various ribo- and deoxynucleic acids indicative for a relaxed substrate specificity. In vitro can unwind partially double-stranded DNA with a preference for 5'- single-stranded DNA overhangs. Is involved in several steps of gene expression, such as transcription, mRNA maturation, mRNA export and translation. However, the exact mechanisms are not known and some functions may be specific for a subset of mRNAs. Involved in transcriptional regulation. Can enhance transcription from the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter in a SP1-dependent manner. Found associated with the E-cadherin promoter and can down-regulate transcription from the promoter. Involved in regulation of translation initiation. Proposed to be involved in positive regulation of translation such as of cyclin E1/CCNE1 mRNA and specifically of mRNAs containing complex secondary structures in their 5'UTRs; these functions seem to require RNA helicase activity. Specifically promotes translation of a subset of viral and cellular mRNAs carrying a 5'proximal stem-loop structure in their 5'UTRs and cooperates with the eIF4F complex. Proposed to act prior to 43S ribosomal scanning and to locally destabilize these RNA structures to allow recognition of the mRNA cap or loading onto the 40S subunit. After association with 40S ribosomal subunits seems to be involved in the functional assembly of 80S ribosomes; the function seems to cover translation of mRNAs with structured and non-structured 5'UTRs and is independent of RNA helicase activity. Also proposed to inhibit cap-dependent translation by competetive interaction with EIF4E which can block the EIF4E:EIF4G complex formation. Proposed to be involved in stress response and stress granule assembly; the function is independent of RNA helicase activity and seems to involve association with EIF4E. May be involved in nuclear export of specific mRNAs but not in bulk mRNA export via interactions with XPO1 and NXF1. Also associates with polyadenylated mRNAs independently of NXF1. Associates with spliced mRNAs in an exon junction complex (EJC)-dependent manner and seems not to be directly involved in splicing. May be involved in nuclear mRNA export by association with DDX5 and regulating its nuclear location. Involved in innate immune signaling promoting the production of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta); proposed to act as viral RNA sensor, signaling intermediate and transcriptional coactivator. Involved in TBK1 and IKBKE-dependent IRF3 activation leading to IFNB induction, plays a role of scaffolding adapter that links IKBKE and IRF3 and coordinates their activation. Also found associated with IFNB promoters; the function is independent of IRF3. Can bind to viral RNAs and via association with MAVS/IPS1 and DDX58/RIG-I is thought to induce signaling in early stages of infection. Involved in regulation of apoptosis. May be required for activation of the intrinsic but inhibit activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Acts as an antiapoptotic protein through association with GSK3A/B and BIRC2 in an apoptosis antagonizing signaling complex; activation of death receptors promotes caspase-dependent cleavage of BIRC2 and DDX3X and relieves the inhibition. May be involved in mitotic chromosome segregation. Is an allosteric activator of CSNK1E, it stimulates CSNK1E-mediated phosphorylation of DVL2 and is involved in the positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling (PubMed:23413191). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16301996, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16818630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17357160, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17667941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18264132, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18583960, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18596238, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18628297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18636090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18846110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20127681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20375222, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20657822, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20837705, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21170385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21730191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21883093, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22034099, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22323517, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22872150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23413191, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23478265}.
FUNCTION: (Microbial infection) Appears to be a prime target for viral manipulations. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase and possibly vaccinia virus (VACV) protein K7 inhibit IFNB induction probably by dissociating DDX3X from TBK1 or IKBKE. Is involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication; the function may involve the association with HCV core protein. HCV core protein inhibits the IPS1-dependent function in viral RNA sensing and may switch the function from a INFB inducing to a HCV replication mode. Involved in HIV-1 replication. Acts as a cofactor for XPO1-mediated nuclear export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 Rev RNAs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10329544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15507209, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21589879}.

DISEASE: Mental retardation, X-linked 102 (MRX102) [MIM:300958]: A form of mental retardation, a disorder characterized by significantly below average general intellectual functioning associated with impairments in adaptive behavior and manifested during the developmental period. Intellectual deficiency is the only primary symptom of non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation, while syndromic mental retardation presents with associated physical, neurological and/or psychiatric manifestations. MRX102 features include mild to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, movement disorders, behavior problems, corpus callosum hypoplasia, and epilepsy. Additionally, patients manifest variable non-neurologic features such as joint hyperlaxity, skin pigmentary abnormalities, cleft lip and/or palate, hearing and visual impairment, and precocious puberty. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:26235985}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.

FUNCTION: Component of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor complex (DSIF complex), which regulates mRNA processing and transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. DSIF positively regulates mRNA capping by stimulating the mRNA guanylyltransferase activity of RNGTT/CAP1A. DSIF also acts cooperatively with the negative elongation factor complex (NELF complex) to enhance transcriptional pausing at sites proximal to the promoter. Transcriptional pausing may facilitate the assembly of an elongation competent RNA polymerase II complex. DSIF and NELF promote pausing by inhibition of the transcription elongation factor TFIIS/S-II. TFIIS/S-II binds to RNA polymerase II at transcription pause sites and stimulates the weak intrinsic nuclease activity of the enzyme. Cleavage of blocked transcripts by RNA polymerase II promotes the resumption of transcription from the new 3' terminus and may allow repeated attempts at transcription through natural pause sites. DSIF can also positively regulate transcriptional elongation and is required for the efficient activation of transcriptional elongation by the HIV- 1 nuclear transcriptional activator, Tat. DSIF acts to suppress transcriptional pausing in transcripts derived from the HIV-1 LTR and blocks premature release of HIV-1 transcripts at terminator sequences. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10075709, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10199401, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10393184, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10421630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10454543, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10757782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10912001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11112772, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11553615, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12653964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14701750, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15136722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15380072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16214896, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9450929, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9514752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9857195}.
SUBUNIT: Interacts with SUPT4H1 to form DSIF. DSIF interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b complex (P-TEFb complex), which is composed of CDK9 and cyclin-T (CCNT1 or CCNT2). DSIF interacts with RNA polymerase II, and this interaction is reduced by phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of POLR2A by P-TEFb. DSIF also interacts with the NELF complex, which is composed of WHSC2/NELFA, COBRA1/NELFB, TH1L/NELFD and RDBP/NELFE, and this interaction occurs following prior binding of DSIF to RNA polymerase II. DSIF also interacts with PRMT1/HRMT1L2, HTATSF1/TATSF1, RNGTT/CAP1A, PRMT5/SKB1, SUPT6H, and can interact with PIN1.

gene names: Name=HNRNPC; Synonyms=HNRPC;
description: RecName: Full=Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2; Short=hnRNP C1/C2;
FUNCTION: Binds pre-mRNA and nucleates the assembly of 40S hnRNP particles (PubMed:8264621). Interacts with poly-U tracts in the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR of mRNA and modulates the stability and the level of translation of bound mRNA molecules (PubMed:12509468, PubMed:16010978, PubMed:7567451, PubMed:8264621). Single HNRNPC tetramers bind 230-240 nucleotides. Trimers of HNRNPC tetramers bind 700 nucleotides (PubMed:8264621). May play a role in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. N6- methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to alter the local structure in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via a mechanism named 'm(6)A-switch', facilitating binding of HNRNPC, leading to regulation of mRNA splicing (PubMed:25719671). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16010978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25719671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7567451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8264621}.

description: RecName: Full=Exportin-1; Short=Exp1; AltName: Full=Chromosome region maintenance 1 protein homolog;
FUNCTION: Mediates the nuclear export of cellular proteins (cargos) bearing a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and of RNAs. In the nucleus, in association with RANBP3, binds cooperatively to the NES on its target protein and to the GTPase RAN in its active GTP-bound form (Ran-GTP). Docking of this complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated through binding to nucleoporins. Upon transit of a nuclear export complex into the cytoplasm, disassembling of the complex and hydrolysis of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP (induced by RANBP1 and RANGAP1, respectively) cause release of the cargo from the export receptor. The directionality of nuclear export is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Involved in U3 snoRNA transport from Cajal bodies to nucleoli. Binds to late precursor U3 snoRNA bearing a TMG cap. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15574332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20921223, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311922, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9323133}.

DISEASE: Trichothiodystrophy 5, non-photosensitive (TTD5) [MIM:300953]: A X-linked form of trichothiodystrophy, a disease characterized by sulfur-deficient brittle hair and multisystem variable abnormalities. The spectrum of clinical features varies from mild disease with only hair involvement to severe disease with cutaneous, neurologic and profound developmental defects. Ichthyosis, intellectual and developmental disabilities, decreased fertility, abnormal characteristics at birth, ocular abnormalities, short stature, and infections are common manifestations. There are both photosensitive and non- photosensitive forms of the disorder. TTD5 features include microcephaly, profound intellectual disability, sparse brittle hair, aged appearance, short stature, facial dysmorphism, seizures, an immunoglobulin deficiency, multiple endocrine abnormalities, cerebellar hypoplasia and partial absence of the corpus callosum, in the absence of cellular photosensitivity and ichthyosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:25612912}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in striated muscles, specifically in type 2a fibers (at protein level). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20634291}.
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE: Induced by 2-fold during pregnancy, including in abdominus rectus muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20634291}.
DOMAIN: Heterotetramerization is mediated by the interaction between a coiled-coil of PRKG1 and the leucine/isoleucine zipper of PPP1R12A/MBS, the myosin-binding subunit of the myosin phosphatase. {ECO:0000250}.
DOMAIN: The KVKF motif mediates interaction with PPP1CB. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225}.
PTM: Phosphorylated by CIT (Rho-associated kinase) (By similarity). Phosphorylated cooperatively by ROCK1 and CDC42BP on Thr-696. Phosphorylated on upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR. In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA and PKG appears to prevent phosphorylation of the inhibitory site Thr-696, probably mediated by PRKG1. Phosphorylation at Ser-445, Ser-472 and Ser-910 by NUAK1 promotes interaction with 14-3-3, leading to inhibit interaction with myosin light chain MLC2, preventing dephosphorylation of MLC2. May be phosphorylated at Thr-696 by DMPK; may inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated at Ser-473 by CDK1 during mitosis, creating docking sites for the POLO box domains of PLK1. Subsequently, PLK1 binds and phosphorylates PPP1R12A. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10567269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11283607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11287000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11331307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12773565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15194681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15723050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17126281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18477460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19131646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19701943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19997641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21457715}.

Its targets include: protein kinase B (PKB/AKT1, PKB/AKT2, PKB/AKT3), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2 and RPS6KA3), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACA), protein kinase C (PRKCD and PRKCZ), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3), p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), protein kinase PKN (PKN1 and PKN2). Plays a central role in the transduction of signals from insulin by providing the activating phosphorylation to PKB/AKT1, thus propagating the signal to downstream targets controlling cell proliferation and survival, as well as glucose and amino acid uptake and storage. Negatively regulates the TGF-beta-induced signaling by: modulating the association of SMAD3 and SMAD7 with TGF-beta receptor, phosphorylating SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7, preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and the translocation of SMAD7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Activates PPARG transcriptional activity and promotes adipocyte differentiation. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via phosphorylation of IKKB. The tyrosine phosphorylated form is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesions by angiotensin II. Controls proliferation, survival, and growth of developing pancreatic cells. Participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of mast cells. Essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response. Plays an important role during thymocyte development by regulating the expression of key nutrient receptors on the surface of pre-T cells and mediating Notch-induced cell growth and proliferative responses. Provides negative feedback inhibition to toll-like receptor-mediated NF- kappa-B activation in macrophages. Isoform 3 is catalytically inactive. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12167717, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17371830, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18835241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9094314, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9445476, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9707564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9768361}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
ENZYME REGULATION: Homodimerization regulates its activity by maintaining the kinase in an autoinhibitory conformation. NPRL2 down-regulates its activity by interfering with tyrosine phosphorylation at the Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 residues. The 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ acts as a negative regulator by association with the residues surrounding the Ser-241 residue. STRAP positively regulates its activity by enhancing its autophosphorylation and by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7 also positively regulate its activity by stimulating its dissociation from YWHAQ. Activated by phosphorylation on Tyr-9, Tyr-373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer in its autoinhibited state. Active as monomer. Interacts with NPRL2, PPARG, PAK1, PTK2B, GRB14, PKN1 (via C- terminus), STRAP and IKKB. The Tyr-9 phosphorylated form interacts with SRC, RASA1 and CRK (via their SH2 domains). Interacts with SGK3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The tyrosine- phosphorylated form interacts with PTPN6. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form interacts with YWHAH and YWHAQ. Binds INSR in response to insulin. Interacts (via PH domain) with SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7. Interacts with PKN2; the interaction stimulates PDPK1 autophosphorylation, its PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent kinase activity toward 'Ser-473' of AKT1 but also activates its kinase activity toward PRKCD and PRKCZ. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10226025, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10995762, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12177059, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14604990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15210700, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16207722, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16251192, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17327236, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18616680, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19591923, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20978239}.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Cell membrane; Peripheral membrane protein. Cell junction, focal adhesion. Note=Tyrosine phosphorylation seems to occur only at the cell membrane. Translocates to the cell membrane following insulin stimulation by a mechanism that involves binding to GRB14 and INSR. SRC and HSP90 promote its localization to the cell membrane. Its nuclear localization is dependent on its association with PTPN6 and its phosphorylation at Ser-396. Restricted to the nucleus in neuronal cells while in non-neuronal cells it is found in the cytoplasm. The Ser-241 phosphorylated form is distributed along the perinuclear region in neuronal cells while in non- neuronal cells it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. IGF1 transiently increases phosphorylation at Ser-241 of neuronal PDPK1, resulting in its translocation to other cellular compartments. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form colocalizes with PTK2B in focal adhesions after angiotensin II stimulation.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Appears to be expressed ubiquitously. The Tyr- 9 phosphorylated form is markedly increased in diseased tissue compared with normal tissue from lung, liver, colon and breast. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18024423}.
INDUCTION: Stimulated by insulin, and the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and peroxovanadate.
DOMAIN: The PH domain plays a pivotal role in the localization and nuclear import of PDPK1 and is also essential for its homodimerization.
DOMAIN: The PIF-pocket is a small lobe in the catalytic domain required by the enzyme for the binding to the hydrophobic motif of its substrates. It is an allosteric regulatory site that can accommodate small compounds acting as allosteric inhibitors. {ECO:0000305|PubMed:22999883}.
PTM: Phosphorylation on Ser-241 in the activation loop is required for full activity. PDPK1 itself can autophosphorylate Ser-241, leading to its own activation. Autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2 (By similarity). Tyr-9 phosphorylation is critical for stabilization of both PDPK1 and the PDPK1/SRC complex via HSP90-mediated protection of PDPK1 degradation. Angiotensin II stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDPK1 in vascular smooth muscle in a calcium- and SRC-dependent manner. Phosphorylated on Tyr-9, Tyr- 373 and Tyr-376 by INSR in response to insulin. Palmitate negatively regulates autophosphorylation at Ser-241 and palmitate- induced phosphorylation at Ser-529 and Ser-501 by PKC/PRKCQ negatively regulates its ability to phosphorylate PKB/AKT1. Phosphorylation at Thr-354 by MELK partially inhibits kinase activity, the inhibition is cooperatively enhanced by phosphorylation at Ser-394 and Ser-398 by MAP3K5. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10455013, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11481331, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14585963, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15743829, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16314505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16780920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22544756, ECO:0000269|Ref.8}.
PTM: Autophosphorylated; autophosphorylation is inhibited by the apoptotic C-terminus cleavage product of PKN2. {ECO:0000250}.
PTM: Monoubiquitinated in the kinase domain, deubiquitinated by USP4.
SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. AGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family. PDPK1 subfamily. {ECO:0000305}.

FUNCTION: Functions in mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Mediates membrane fission through oligomerization into membrane- associated tubular structures that wrap around the scission site to constrict and sever the mitochondrial membrane through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. Through its function in mitochondrial division, ensures the survival of at least some types of postmitotic neurons, including Purkinje cells, by suppressing oxidative damage. Required for normal brain development, including that of cerebellum. Facilitates developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation. Required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis; this requirement may depend upon the cell type and the physiological apoptotic cues. Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:26992161). Required for formation of endocytic vesicles. Proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics through association with BCL2L1 isoform Bcl-X(L) which stimulates its GTPase activity in synaptic vesicles; the function may require its recruitment by MFF to clathrin-containing vesicles.

SUBUNIT: Homotetramer; dimerizes through the N-terminal GTP-middle region of one molecule binding to the GED domain of another DNM1L molecule. Oligomerizes in a GTP-dependent manner to form membrane- associated tubules with a spiral pattern. Can also oligomerize to form multimeric ring-like structures. Interacts with GSK3B and MARCH5. Interacts (via the GTPase and B domains) with UBE2I; the interaction promotes sumoylation of DNM1L, mainly in its B domain. Interacts with PPP3CA; the interaction dephosphorylates DNM1L and regulates its transition to mitochondria. Interacts with BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) and CLTA; DNM1L and BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) may form a complex in synaptic vesicles that also contains clathrin and MFF. Interacts with FIS1. Interacts with MIEF2 and MIEF1; this regulates GTP hydrolysis and DNM1L oligomerization. Interacts with PGAM5; this interaction leads to dephosphorylation at Ser-656 and activation of GTPase activity and eventually to mitochondria fragmentation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16874301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16936636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21508961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21701560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23530241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23584531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23792689, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23977156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27145208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200}.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed with highest levels found in skeletal muscles, heart, kidney and brain. Isoform 1 is brain-specific. Isoform 2 and isoform 3 are predominantly expressed in testis and skeletal muscles respectively. Isoform 4 is weakly expressed in brain, heart and kidney. Isoform 5 is dominantly expressed in liver, heart and kidney. Isoform 6 is expressed in neurons. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9422767, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9570752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9786947}.
DOMAIN: The GED domain folds back to interact, in cis, with the GTP-binding domain and middle domain, and interacts, in trans, with the GED domains of other DNM1L molecules, and is thus critical for activating GTPase activity and for DNM1L dimerization.
PTM: Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on two sites near the GED domain regulate mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-637 inhibits the GTPase activity, leading to a defect in mitochondrial fission promoting mitochondrial elongation. Dephosphorylated on this site by PPP3CA which promotes mitochondrial fission. Phosphorylation on Ser-616 activates the GTPase activity and promotes mitochondrial fission. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17301055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26122121}.

Interacts (via the GTPase and B domains) with UBE2I; the interaction promotes sumoylation of DNM1L, mainly in its B domain. Interacts with PPP3CA; the interaction dephosphorylates DNM1L and regulates its transition to mitochondria. Interacts with BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) and CLTA; DNM1L and BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) may form a complex in synaptic vesicles that also contains clathrin and MFF. Interacts with FIS1. Interacts with MIEF2 and MIEF1; this regulates GTP hydrolysis and DNM1L oligomerization. Interacts with PGAM5; this interaction leads to dephosphorylation at Ser-656 and activation of GTPase activity and eventually to mitochondria fragmentation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10749171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16874301, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16936636, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21508961, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21701560, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22265414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23530241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23584531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23792689, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23977156, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27145208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9731200}.

FUNCTION: Functions in mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Mediates membrane fission through oligomerization into membrane- associated tubular structures that wrap around the scission site to constrict and sever the mitochondrial membrane through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. Through its function in mitochondrial division, ensures the survival of at least some types of postmitotic neurons, including Purkinje cells, by suppressing oxidative damage. Required for normal brain development, including that of cerebellum. Facilitates developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation. Required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis; this requirement may depend upon the cell type and the physiological apoptotic cues. Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:26992161). Required for formation of endocytic vesicles. Proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics through association with BCL2L1 isoform Bcl-X(L) which stimulates its GTPase activity in synaptic vesicles; the function may require its recruitment by MFF to clathrin-containing vesicles.

FUNCTION: Functions in mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Mediates membrane fission through oligomerization into membrane- associated tubular structures that wrap around the scission site to constrict and sever the mitochondrial membrane through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. Through its function in mitochondrial division, ensures the survival of at least some types of postmitotic neurons, including Purkinje cells, by suppressing oxidative damage. Required for normal brain development, including that of cerebellum. Facilitates developmentally regulated apoptosis during neural tube formation. Required for a normal rate of cytochrome c release and caspase activation during apoptosis; this requirement may depend upon the cell type and the physiological apoptotic cues. Plays an important role in mitochondrial fission during mitosis (PubMed:26992161). Required for formation of endocytic vesicles. Proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics through association with BCL2L1 isoform Bcl-X(L) which stimulates its GTPase activity in synaptic vesicles; the function may require its recruitment by MFF to clathrin-containing vesicles. Required for programmed necrosis execution. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11514614, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12499366, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17015472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17301055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17460227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17553808, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18695047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18838687, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19342591, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19411255, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19638400, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20688057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23283981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23530241, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23584531, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23921378, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26992161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27145208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9570752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9786947}.

SUBUNIT: Homotetramer; dimerizes through the N-terminal GTP-middle region of one molecule binding to the GED domain of another DNM1L molecule. Oligomerizes in a GTP-dependent manner to form membrane- associated tubules with a spiral pattern. Can also oligomerize to form multimeric ring-like structures. Interacts with GSK3B and MARCH5. Interacts (via the GTPase and B domains) with UBE2I; the interaction promotes sumoylation of DNM1L, mainly in its B domain. Interacts with PPP3CA; the interaction dephosphorylates DNM1L and regulates its transition to mitochondria. Interacts with BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) and CLTA; DNM1L and BCL2L1 isoform BCL-X(L) may form a complex in synaptic vesicles that also contains clathrin and MFF. Interacts with FIS1.

FUNCTION: Lipid-binding protein that transports phosphatidylinositol, the precursor of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane (PubMed:28209843). It thereby maintains the pool of cell membrane phosphoinositides, which are degraded during phospholipase C (PLC) signaling (PubMed:28209843). Plays a key role in the coordination of Ca(2+) and phosphoinositide signaling: localizes to sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane, where it tethers the two bilayers (PubMed:28209843). In response to elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+), it is phosphorylated at its C- terminus and dissociates from the cell membrane, abolishing phosphatidylinositol transport to the cell membrane (PubMed:28209843). Positively regulates insulin secretion in response to glucose: phosphatidylinositol transfer to the cell membrane allows replenishment of PI(4,5)P2 pools and calcium channel opening, priming a new population of insulin granules (PubMed:28209843). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:28209843}.

description: RecName: Full=Nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha; Short=NAC-alpha; AltName: Full=Alpha-NAC; AltName: Allergen=Hom s 2;
FUNCTION: Prevents inappropriate targeting of non-secretory polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Binds to nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from the ribosome and blocks their interaction with the signal recognition particle (SRP), which normally targets nascent secretory peptides to the ER. Also reduces the inherent affinity of ribosomes for protein translocation sites in the ER membrane (M sites). May act as a specific coactivator for JUN, binding to DNA and stabilizing the interaction of JUN homodimers with target gene promoters. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10982809, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15784678, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9877153}.
SUBUNIT: Interacts with TBP and JUN (By similarity). Part of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), which is a heterodimer of NACA and BTF3 (via NAC-A/B domains).

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitously expressed. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16201836}.
DOMAIN: The positively charged inner surface of the NAC-A/B domain is crucial for NACA localization in the nucleus and DNA-binding. This region is blocked from binding nucleic acids in the heterodimeric complex by a helix region in the beta-subunit, it also displays much higher affinity for RNA than DNA.
PTM: Phosphorylation of Thr-159 by GSK3B may promote proteasome mediated degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylation of Ser-43 by ILK during cell adhesion may promote nuclear localization. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15299025, ECO:0000269|Ref.13}.

PTM: Phosphorylated by CIT (Rho-associated kinase) (By similarity). Phosphorylated cooperatively by ROCK1 and CDC42BP on Thr-696. Phosphorylated on upon DNA damage, probably by ATM or ATR. In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA and PKG appears to prevent phosphorylation of the inhibitory site Thr-696, probably mediated by PRKG1. Phosphorylation at Ser-445, Ser-472 and Ser-910 by NUAK1 promotes interaction with 14-3-3, leading to inhibit interaction with myosin light chain MLC2, preventing dephosphorylation of MLC2. May be phosphorylated at Thr-696 by DMPK; may inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated at Ser-473 by CDK1 during mitosis, creating docking sites for the POLO box domains of PLK1. Subsequently, PLK1 binds and phosphorylates PPP1R12A. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10567269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11283607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11287000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11331307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12773565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15194681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15723050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17126281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18477460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19131646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19701943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19997641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21457715}.

description: RecName: Full=Importin subunit alpha-4; AltName: Full=Importin alpha Q2; Short=Qip2; AltName: Full=Karyopherin subunit alpha-3; AltName: Full=SRP1-gamma;
FUNCTION: Functions in nuclear protein import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1. Binds specifically and directly to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran- dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. In vitro, mediates the nuclear import of human cytomegalovirus UL84 by recognizing a non- classical NLS. Recognizes NLSs of influenza A virus nucleoprotein probably through ARM repeats 7-9.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm {ECO:0000250}. Nucleus {ECO:0000250}.
TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous. Highest levels in heart and skeletal muscle.
DOMAIN: Consists of an N-terminal hydrophilic region, a hydrophobic central region composed of 10 repeats, and a short hydrophilic C-terminus. The N-terminal hydrophilic region contains the importin beta binding domain (IBB domain), which is sufficient for binding importin beta and essential for nuclear protein import.
DOMAIN: The IBB domain is thought to act as an intrasteric autoregulatory sequence by interacting with the internal autoinhibitory NLS. Binding of KPNB1 probably overlaps the internal NLS and contributes to a high affinity for cytoplasmic NLS-containing cargo substrates. After dissociation of the importin/substrate complex in the nucleus the internal autohibitory NLS contributes to a low affinity for nuclear NLS- containing proteins (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
DOMAIN: The major and minor NLS binding sites are mainly involved in recognition of simple or bipartite NLS motifs. Structurally located within in a helical surface groove they contain several conserved Trp and Asn residues of the corresponding third helices (H3) of ARM repeats which mainly contribute to binding (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
SIMILARITY: Belongs to the importin alpha family. {ECO:0000305}.

FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Plays an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by changes in the environment. Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR). Ceramides are also able to activate MAP3K7/TAK1. Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7. These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKK). Both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), while nuclear factor-kappa B is activated by IKK. MAP3K7 activates also IKBKB and MAPK8/JNK1 in response to TRAF6 signaling and mediates BMP2- induced apoptosis. In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10094049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11460167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12589052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16845370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16893890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21512573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9079627}.

FUNCTION: Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Stimulates the ATPase and RNA- helicase activities of EIF4A3. Plays a role in the stress response by participating in cytoplasmic stress granules assembly and by favoring cell recovery following stress. Component of the dendritic ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) in hippocampal neurons. May play a role in mRNA transport. Binds spliced mRNA in sequence-independent manner, 20-24 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions. Binds poly(G) and poly(U) RNA homopolymer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17375189, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17652158}.

FUNCTION: Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Binds DNA non-specifically. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A2BH40, ECO:0000303|PubMed:12672490, ECO:0000303|PubMed:22952240, ECO:0000303|PubMed:26601204}.

description: RecName: Full=Serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1; EC=2.7.11.1; AltName: Full=Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1;
FUNCTION: Serine/threonine-protein kinase which is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of ion channels, membrane transporters, cellular enzymes, transcription factors, neuronal excitability, cell growth, proliferation, survival, migration and apoptosis. Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.
ENZYME REGULATION: Two specific sites, one in the kinase domain (Thr-256) and the other in the C-terminal regulatory region (Ser- 422), need to be phosphorylated for its full activation. Phosphorylation at Ser-397 and Ser-401 are also essential for its activity. Activated by WNK1, WNK2, WNK3 and WNK4.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer; disulfide-linked. Forms a trimeric complex with FBXW7 and NOTCH1.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Cell membrane. Mitochondrion. Note=The subcellular localization is controlled by the cell cycle, as well as by exposure to specific hormones and environmental stress stimuli. In proliferating cells, it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in synchrony with the cell cycle, and in serum/growth factor- stimulated cells it resides in the nucleus. In contrast, after exposure to environmental stress or treatment with glucocorticoids, it is detected in the cytoplasm and with certain stress conditions is associated with the mitochondria. In osmoregulation through the epithelial sodium channel, it can be localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Nuclear, upon phosphorylation.
SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Isoform 2: Cell membrane.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in most tissues with highest levels in the pancreas, followed by placenta, kidney and lung. Isoform 2 is strongly expressed in brain and pancreas, weaker in heart, placenta, lung, liver and skeletal muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10548550, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
INDUCTION: Induced by a very large spectrum of stimuli distinct from glucocorticoids and serum. These include aldosterone, cell shrinkage, cell swelling, TGF-beta, ischemic injury of the brain, neuronal excitotoxicity memory consolidation, chronic viral hepatitis, DNA-damaging agents, vitamin D3 psychophysiological stress, iron, glucose, EDN1, CSF2, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbolesters, follicle- stimulating hormone, sorbitol, heat shock, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and p53/TP53. Many of these stimuli are highly cell- specific, as is the case, for example for aldosterone, which has been found to stimulate its expression only in cells derived from aldosterone-responsive epithelia. Isoform 2 is not induced by glucocorticoids but by excessive extracellular glucose and by TGFB1, in cultured cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
DOMAIN: Isoform 2 subcellular localization at the cell membrane and resistance to proteasomal degradation is mediated by the sequences within the first 120 amino acids.
PTM: Regulated by phosphorylation. Activated by phosphorylation on Ser-422 by mTORC2, transforming it into a substrate for PDPK1 which phosphorylates it on Thr-256. Phosphorylation on Ser-397 and Ser-401 are also essential for its activity. Phosphorylation on Ser-78 by MAPK7 is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10191262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11096081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11254654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18925875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19068477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20338997}.
PTM: Ubiquitinated by NEDD4L; which promotes proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated by SYVN1 at the endoplasmic reticulum; which promotes rapid proteasomal degradation and maintains a high turnover rate in resting cells. Isoform 2 shows enhanced stability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576372}.
SIMILARITY: Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. AGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family. {ECO:0000305}.

In contrast, after exposure to environmental stress or treatment with glucocorticoids, it is detected in the cytoplasm and with certain stress conditions is associated with the mitochondria. In osmoregulation through the epithelial sodium channel, it can be localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Nuclear, upon phosphorylation.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in most tissues with highest levels in the pancreas, followed by placenta, kidney and lung. Isoform 2 is strongly expressed in brain and pancreas, weaker in heart, placenta, lung, liver and skeletal muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10548550, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
INDUCTION: Induced by a very large spectrum of stimuli distinct from glucocorticoids and serum. These include aldosterone, cell shrinkage, cell swelling, TGF-beta, ischemic injury of the brain, neuronal excitotoxicity memory consolidation, chronic viral hepatitis, DNA-damaging agents, vitamin D3 psychophysiological stress, iron, glucose, EDN1, CSF2, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbolesters, follicle- stimulating hormone, sorbitol, heat shock, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and p53/TP53. Many of these stimuli are highly cell- specific, as is the case, for example for aldosterone, which has been found to stimulate its expression only in cells derived from aldosterone-responsive epithelia. Isoform 2 is not induced by glucocorticoids but by excessive extracellular glucose and by TGFB1, in cultured cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
DOMAIN: Isoform 2 subcellular localization at the cell membrane and resistance to proteasomal degradation is mediated by the sequences within the first 120 amino acids.

gene names: Name=SGK1; Synonyms=SGK;
description: RecName: Full=Serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1; EC=2.7.11.1; AltName: Full=Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1;
FUNCTION: Serine/threonine-protein kinase which is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of ion channels, membrane transporters, cellular enzymes, transcription factors, neuronal excitability, cell growth, proliferation, survival, migration and apoptosis. Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.

description: RecName: Full=Coatomer subunit epsilon; AltName: Full=Epsilon-coat protein; Short=Epsilon-COP;
FUNCTION: The coatomer is a cytosolic protein complex that binds to dilysine motifs and reversibly associates with Golgi non- clathrin-coated vesicles, which further mediate biosynthetic protein transport from the ER, via the Golgi up to the trans Golgi network. The coatomer complex is required for budding from Golgi membranes, and is essential for the retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-tagged proteins. In mammals, the coatomer can only be recruited by membranes associated with ADP- ribosylation factors (ARFs), which are small GTP-binding proteins; the complex also influences the Golgi structural integrity, as well as the processing, activity, and endocytic recycling of LDL receptors (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
SUBUNIT: Oligomeric complex that consists of at least the alpha, beta, beta', gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta subunits.

In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA and PKG appears to prevent phosphorylation of the inhibitory site Thr-696, probably mediated by PRKG1. Phosphorylation at Ser-445, Ser-472 and Ser-910 by NUAK1 promotes interaction with 14-3-3, leading to inhibit interaction with myosin light chain MLC2, preventing dephosphorylation of MLC2. May be phosphorylated at Thr-696 by DMPK; may inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated at Ser-473 by CDK1 during mitosis, creating docking sites for the POLO box domains of PLK1. Subsequently, PLK1 binds and phosphorylates PPP1R12A. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10567269, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11283607, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11287000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11331307, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12773565, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15194681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15723050, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17126281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18477460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19131646, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19701943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19997641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20354225, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21457715}.

description: RecName: Full=Cytoplasmic dynein 1 light intermediate chain 2; AltName: Full=Dynein light intermediate chain 2, cytosolic; Short=LIC-2; AltName: Full=LIC53/55;
FUNCTION: Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. May play a role in binding dynein to membranous organelles or chromosomes.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity). The cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex consists of two catalytic heavy chains (HCs) and a number of non-catalytic subunits presented by intermediate chains (ICs), light intermediate chains (LICs) and light chains (LCs); the composition seems to vary in respect to the IC, LIC and LC composition. The heavy chain homodimer serves as a scaffold for the probable homodimeric assembly of the respective non-catalytic subunits. The ICs and LICs bind directly to the HC dimer and the LCs assemble on the IC dimer. Self-associates. Interacts with DYNC1H1; DYNC1LI1 and DYNC1LI2 bind mutually exclusive to DYNC1H1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

gene names: Name=HNRNPC; Synonyms=HNRPC;
description: RecName: Full=Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2; Short=hnRNP C1/C2;
FUNCTION: Binds pre-mRNA and nucleates the assembly of 40S hnRNP particles (PubMed:8264621). Interacts with poly-U tracts in the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR of mRNA and modulates the stability and the level of translation of bound mRNA molecules (PubMed:12509468, PubMed:16010978, PubMed:7567451, PubMed:8264621). Single HNRNPC tetramers bind 230-240 nucleotides. Trimers of HNRNPC tetramers bind 700 nucleotides (PubMed:8264621). May play a role in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. N6- methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to alter the local structure in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via a mechanism named 'm(6)A-switch', facilitating binding of HNRNPC, leading to regulation of mRNA splicing (PubMed:25719671). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16010978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25719671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7567451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8264621}.

gene names: Name=HNRNPC; Synonyms=HNRPC;
description: RecName: Full=Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2; Short=hnRNP C1/C2;
FUNCTION: Binds pre-mRNA and nucleates the assembly of 40S hnRNP particles (PubMed:8264621). Interacts with poly-U tracts in the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR of mRNA and modulates the stability and the level of translation of bound mRNA molecules (PubMed:12509468, PubMed:16010978, PubMed:7567451, PubMed:8264621). Single HNRNPC tetramers bind 230-240 nucleotides. Trimers of HNRNPC tetramers bind 700 nucleotides (PubMed:8264621). May play a role in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. N6- methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to alter the local structure in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via a mechanism named 'm(6)A-switch', facilitating binding of HNRNPC, leading to regulation of mRNA splicing (PubMed:25719671). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12509468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16010978, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25719671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7567451, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8264621}.
SUBUNIT: Tetramer composed of 3 copies of isoform C1 and 1 copy of isoform C2. Assembly of 3 tetramers with bound pre-mRNA gives rise to a 19S complex that interacts with HNRNPA2B1 tetramers. Component of the 40S hnRNP particle. Identified in the spliceosome C complex. Interacts with IGF2BP1. Interacts with DHX9; this interaction is direct, enhanced probably by their concomitant binding to RNA and mediates the attachment to actin filaments (PubMed:11687588). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11162094, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11687588, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11991638, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15936032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17289661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8264621}.

FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Plays an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by changes in the environment. Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR). Ceramides are also able to activate MAP3K7/TAK1. Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7. These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKK). Both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), while nuclear factor-kappa B is activated by IKK. MAP3K7 activates also IKBKB and MAPK8/JNK1 in response to TRAF6 signaling and mediates BMP2- induced apoptosis. In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10094049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11460167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12589052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16845370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16893890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21512573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9079627}.

FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Plays an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by changes in the environment. Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR). Ceramides are also able to activate MAP3K7/TAK1. Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7. These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKK). Both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), while nuclear factor-kappa B is activated by IKK. MAP3K7 activates also IKBKB and MAPK8/JNK1 in response to TRAF6 signaling and mediates BMP2- induced apoptosis. In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10094049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11460167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12589052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16845370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16893890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21512573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9079627}.

FUNCTION: Component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins. This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Inhibits the transactivation function of HIF- 1A under both normoxic and hypoxia-mimicking conditions. The interaction with EMAP2 increases the proteasome-mediated HIF-1A degradation under the hypoxic conditions. Plays a role in hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. Mediates nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR) and thereby enhances androgen-mediated transactivation. Promotes MAVS degradation and thereby negatively regulates MAVS-mediated innate immune response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11389899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11713272, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12119296, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15244466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19442227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19734229, ECO:0000269|PubMed:27176742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8610016}.

FUNCTION: Transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm by negatively regulating the activity of the clock genes and clock-controlled genes. Acts as the negative limb of a novel autoregulatory feedback loop (DEC loop) which differs from the one formed by the PER and CRY transcriptional repressors (PER/CRY loop). Both these loops are interlocked as it represses the expression of PER1/2 and in turn is repressed by PER1/2 and CRY1/2. Represses the activity of the circadian transcriptional activator: CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer by competing for the binding to E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') found within the promoters of its target genes. Negatively regulates its own expression and the expression of DBP and BHLHE41/DEC2. Acts as a corepressor of RXR and the RXR-LXR heterodimers and represses the ligand-induced RXRA and NR1H3/LXRA transactivation activity. May be involved in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation via the cAMP pathway. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14672706, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15193144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15560782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18411297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19786558}.

FUNCTION: The SMN complex plays a catalyst role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. Dissociation by the SMN complex of CLNS1A from the trapped Sm proteins and their transfer to an SMN-Sm complex triggers the assembly of core snRNPs and their transport to the nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9323129}.

FUNCTION: The SMN complex plays a catalyst role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. Dissociation by the SMN complex of CLNS1A from the trapped Sm proteins and their transfer to an SMN-Sm complex triggers the assembly of core snRNPs and their transport to the nucleus. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18984161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9323129}.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Widely expressed. Expressed in ovary, testis, prostate, thymus, muscle and heart, but not in small intestine, colon, lymph nodes, or peripherical blood lymphocytes. The protein is not detected in any of the above organs.
INDUCTION: By estrogen.
DOMAIN: The coiled coil domain is necessary for the homodimerization.
MISCELLANEOUS: May serve as a prognostic marker for cancers such as adenocarcinomas of the lung and breast cancers. It is present and overexpressed in many patients suffering from breast carcinomas, its level of expression correlates with tumor grade, suggesting that it may be involved in cancer immune escape. According to PubMed:12672804, it is however not directly a tumor- associated antigen, but it rather modulates surface expression of tumor-associated O-linked glycan Tn when it is overexpressed, suggesting that it contributes indirectly to the antigenicity of tumor cells.
CAUTION: It was initially reported to be a ligand for some putative receptor present on T-, B-, natural killer (NK) cells and various human cell lines. However, PubMed:12672804 showed that it does not bind any receptor. {ECO:0000305}.

FUNCTION: Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphatase that specifically hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol- 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) to produce PtdIns(3,4)P2, thereby negatively regulating the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathways. Plays a central role in regulation of PI3K-dependent insulin signaling, although the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain unclear. While overexpression reduces both insulin-stimulated MAP kinase and Akt activation, its absence does not affect insulin signaling or GLUT4 trafficking. Confers resistance to dietary obesity. May act by regulating AKT2, but not AKT1, phosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Part of a signaling pathway that regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Required for the maintenance and dynamic remodeling of actin structures as well as in endocytosis, having a major impact on ligand-induced EGFR internalization and degradation. Participates in regulation of cortical and submembraneous actin by hydrolyzing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 thereby regulating membrane ruffling (PubMed:21624956). Regulates cell adhesion and cell spreading. Required for HGF-mediated lamellipodium formation, cell scattering and spreading. Acts as a negative regulator of EPHA2 receptor endocytosis by inhibiting via PI3K-dependent Rac1 activation. Acts as a regulator of neuritogenesis by regulating PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 level and is required to form an initial protrusive pattern, and later, maintain proper neurite outgrowth. Acts as a negative regulator of the FC-gamma- RIIA receptor (FCGR2A). Mediates signaling from the FC-gamma-RIIB receptor (FCGR2B), playing a central role in terminating signal transduction from activating immune/hematopoietic cell receptor systems. Involved in EGF signaling pathway. Upon stimulation by EGF, it is recruited by EGFR and dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Plays a negative role in regulating the PI3K-PKB pathway, possibly by inhibiting PKB activity. Down-regulates Fc-gamma-R-mediated phagocytosis in macrophages independently of INPP5D/SHIP1. In macrophages, down-regulates NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription by regulating macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced signaling. May also hydrolyze PtdIns(1,3,4,5)P4, and could thus affect the levels of the higher inositol polyphosphates like InsP6.

FUNCTION: Subunit of non-clathrin- and clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-3 appears to be involved in the sorting of a subset of transmembrane proteins targeted to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
SUBUNIT: AP-3 associates with the BLOC-1 complex (By similarity). Adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) is a heterotetramer composed of two large adaptins (delta-type subunit AP3D1 and beta-type subunit AP3B1 or AP3B2), a medium adaptin (mu-type subunit AP3M1 or AP3M2) and a small adaptin (sigma-type subunit APS1 or AP3S2). {ECO:0000250}.

DISEASE: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 2 (HPS2) [MIM:608233]: A form of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding due to platelet storage pool deficiency, and lysosomal storage defects. This syndrome results from defects of diverse cytoplasmic organelles including melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes. Ceroid storage in the lungs is associated with pulmonary fibrosis, a common cause of premature death in individuals with HPS. HPS2 differs from the other forms of HPS in that it includes immunodeficiency in its phenotype and patients with HPS2 have an increased susceptibility to infections. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10024875}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.

gene names: Name=SGK1; Synonyms=SGK;
description: RecName: Full=Serine/threonine-protein kinase Sgk1; EC=2.7.11.1; AltName: Full=Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1;
FUNCTION: Serine/threonine-protein kinase which is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of ion channels, membrane transporters, cellular enzymes, transcription factors, neuronal excitability, cell growth, proliferation, survival, migration and apoptosis. Plays an important role in cellular stress response. Contributes to regulation of renal Na(+) retention, renal K(+) elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Up-regulates Na(+) channels: SCNN1A/ENAC, SCN5A and ASIC1/ACCN2, K(+) channels: KCNJ1/ROMK1, KCNA1-5, KCNQ1-5 and KCNE1, epithelial Ca(2+) channels: TRPV5 and TRPV6, chloride channels: BSND, CLCN2 and CFTR, glutamate transporters: SLC1A3/EAAT1, SLC1A2 /EAAT2, SLC1A1/EAAT3, SLC1A6/EAAT4 and SLC1A7/EAAT5, amino acid transporters: SLC1A5/ASCT2, SLC38A1/SN1 and SLC6A19, creatine transporter: SLC6A8, Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter: SLC13A2/NADC1, Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter: SLC34A2/NAPI-2B, glutamate receptor: GRIK2/GLUR6. Up-regulates carriers: SLC9A3/NHE3, SLC12A1/NKCC2, SLC12A3/NCC, SLC5A3/SMIT, SLC2A1/GLUT1, SLC5A1/SGLT1 and SLC15A2/PEPT2. Regulates enzymes: GSK3A/B, PMM2 and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase, and transcription factors: CTNNB1 and nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. Stimulates sodium transport into epithelial cells by enhancing the stability and expression of SCNN1A/ENAC. This is achieved by phosphorylating the NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase, promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, thereby preventing it from binding to SCNN1A/ENAC and targeting it for degradation. Regulates store-operated Ca(+2) entry (SOCE) by stimulating ORAI1 and STIM1. Regulates KCNJ1/ROMK1 directly via its phosphorylation or indirectly via increased interaction with SLC9A3R2/NHERF2. Phosphorylates MDM2 and activates MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Phosphorylates MAPT/TAU and mediates microtubule depolymerization and neurite formation in hippocampal neurons. Phosphorylates SLC2A4/GLUT4 and up-regulates its activity. Phosphorylates APBB1/FE65 and promotes its localization to the nucleus. Phosphorylates MAPK1/ERK2 and activates it by enhancing its interaction with MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Phosphorylates FBXW7 and plays an inhibitory role in the NOTCH1 signaling. Phosphorylates FOXO1 resulting in its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Phosphorylates FOXO3, promoting its exit from the nucleus and interference with FOXO3-dependent transcription. Phosphorylates BRAF and MAP3K3/MEKK3 and inhibits their activity. Phosphorylates SLC9A3/NHE3 in response to dexamethasone, resulting in its activation and increased localization at the cell membrane. Phosphorylates CREB1. Necessary for vascular remodeling during angiogenesis. Sustained high levels and activity may contribute to conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Isoform 2 exhibited a greater effect on cell plasma membrane expression of SCNN1A/ENAC and Na(+) transport than isoform 1. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154281, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11410590, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11696533, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12397388, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12590200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12634932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12650886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12761204, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12911626, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14623317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14706641, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15040001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15044175, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15234985, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15319523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15496163, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733869, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15737648, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15845389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15888551, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16036218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16443776, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17382906, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18005662, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18304449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19447520, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19756449, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20511718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20730100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21865597}.
CATALYTIC ACTIVITY: ATP + a protein = ADP + a phosphoprotein.

SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Cell membrane. Mitochondrion. Note=The subcellular localization is controlled by the cell cycle, as well as by exposure to specific hormones and environmental stress stimuli. In proliferating cells, it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in synchrony with the cell cycle, and in serum/growth factor- stimulated cells it resides in the nucleus. In contrast, after exposure to environmental stress or treatment with glucocorticoids, it is detected in the cytoplasm and with certain stress conditions is associated with the mitochondria. In osmoregulation through the epithelial sodium channel, it can be localized to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Nuclear, upon phosphorylation.

TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in most tissues with highest levels in the pancreas, followed by placenta, kidney and lung. Isoform 2 is strongly expressed in brain and pancreas, weaker in heart, placenta, lung, liver and skeletal muscle. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10548550, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
INDUCTION: Induced by a very large spectrum of stimuli distinct from glucocorticoids and serum. These include aldosterone, cell shrinkage, cell swelling, TGF-beta, ischemic injury of the brain, neuronal excitotoxicity memory consolidation, chronic viral hepatitis, DNA-damaging agents, vitamin D3 psychophysiological stress, iron, glucose, EDN1, CSF2, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, phorbolesters, follicle- stimulating hormone, sorbitol, heat shock, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and p53/TP53. Many of these stimuli are highly cell- specific, as is the case, for example for aldosterone, which has been found to stimulate its expression only in cells derived from aldosterone-responsive epithelia. Isoform 2 is not induced by glucocorticoids but by excessive extracellular glucose and by TGFB1, in cultured cells. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18753299}.
DOMAIN: Isoform 2 subcellular localization at the cell membrane and resistance to proteasomal degradation is mediated by the sequences within the first 120 amino acids.
PTM: Regulated by phosphorylation. Activated by phosphorylation on Ser-422 by mTORC2, transforming it into a substrate for PDPK1 which phosphorylates it on Thr-256. Phosphorylation on Ser-397 and Ser-401 are also essential for its activity. Phosphorylation on Ser-78 by MAPK7 is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10191262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11096081, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11254654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18925875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19068477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20338997}.
PTM: Ubiquitinated by NEDD4L; which promotes proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitinated by SYVN1 at the endoplasmic reticulum; which promotes rapid proteasomal degradation and maintains a high turnover rate in resting cells. Isoform 2 shows enhanced stability. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576372}.

FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Plays an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by changes in the environment. Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR). Ceramides are also able to activate MAP3K7/TAK1. Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7. These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKK). Both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), while nuclear factor-kappa B is activated by IKK. MAP3K7 activates also IKBKB and MAPK8/JNK1 in response to TRAF6 signaling and mediates BMP2- induced apoptosis. In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10094049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11460167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12589052, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16845370, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16893890, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21512573, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8663074, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9079627}.

FUNCTION: Catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4- phosphate (PtdIns4P) to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). PtdIns(4,5)P2 is involved in a variety of cellular processes and is the substrate to form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), another second messenger. The majority of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is thought to occur via type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases given the abundance of PtdIns4P. Participates in a variety of cellular processes such as actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, migration and phagocytosis. Required for membrane ruffling formation, actin organization and focal adhesion formation during directional cell migration by controlling integrin-induced translocation of RAC1 to the plasma membrane. Together with PIP5K1C is required for phagocytosis, but they regulate different types of actin remodeling at sequential steps. Promotes particle ingestion by activating WAS that induces Arp2/3 dependent actin polymerization at the nascent phagocytic cup. Together with PIP5K1B is required after stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors for stable platelet adhesion. Plays a role during calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation. Recruited to the plasma membrane by the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex where it provides the substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2 for the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that mobilize internal calcium and drive keratinocyte differentiation. Together with PIP5K1C have a role during embryogenesis. Functions also in the nucleus where acts as an activator of TUT1 adenylyltransferase activity in nuclear speckles, thereby regulating mRNA polyadenylation of a select set of mRNAs. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18288197, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19158393, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20660631}.

FUNCTION: Involved in the generation of internal asymmetric signals required for neuronal polarization and neurite outgrowth. Mediates netrin-1-induced F-actin-substrate coupling or 'clutch engagement' within the axon growth cone through activation of CDC42, RAC1 and PAK1-dependent signaling pathway, thereby converting the F-actin retrograde flow into traction forces, concomitantly with filopodium extension and axon outgrowth. Plays a role in cytoskeletal organization by regulating the subcellular localization of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity at the axonal growth cone. Plays also a role in regenerative neurite outgrowth. In the developing cortex, cooperates with KIF20B to promote both the transition from the multipolar to the bipolar stage and the radial migration of cortical neurons from the ventricular zone toward the superficial layer of the neocortex. Involved in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5- trisphosphate (PIP3) in the growth cone of primary hippocampal neurons. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A0MZ67, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8K2Q9}.

Plays a role in cytoskeletal organization by regulating the subcellular localization of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity at the axonal growth cone. Plays also a role in regenerative neurite outgrowth. In the developing cortex, cooperates with KIF20B to promote both the transition from the multipolar to the bipolar stage and the radial migration of cortical neurons from the ventricular zone toward the superficial layer of the neocortex. Involved in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5- trisphosphate (PIP3) in the growth cone of primary hippocampal neurons. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:A0MZ67, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q8K2Q9}.
SUBUNIT: Interacts with L1CAM; this interaction occurs in axonal growth cones. Interacts with actin filament retrograde flow; this interaction is enhanced in a netrin-1- and PAK1-dependent manner and promotes F-actin-substrate coupling and concomitant formation of traction forces at axonal growth cones. Interacts with RUFY3. Interacts with PFN2. Interacts (via N-terminus) with KIF20B; this interaction is direct and promotes the association of SHTN1 to microtubules in primary neurons.

gene names: Name=DYNC1LI2; Synonyms=DNCLI2, LIC2;
description: RecName: Full=Cytoplasmic dynein 1 light intermediate chain 2; AltName: Full=Dynein light intermediate chain 2, cytosolic; Short=LIC-2; AltName: Full=LIC53/55;
FUNCTION: Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. May play a role in binding dynein to membranous organelles or chromosomes.
SUBUNIT: Homodimer (By similarity). The cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex consists of two catalytic heavy chains (HCs) and a number of non-catalytic subunits presented by intermediate chains (ICs), light intermediate chains (LICs) and light chains (LCs); the composition seems to vary in respect to the IC, LIC and LC composition. The heavy chain homodimer serves as a scaffold for the probable homodimeric assembly of the respective non-catalytic subunits. The ICs and LICs bind directly to the HC dimer and the LCs assemble on the IC dimer. Self-associates. Interacts with DYNC1H1; DYNC1LI1 and DYNC1LI2 bind mutually exclusive to DYNC1H1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton {ECO:0000250}.

SIMILARITY: Belongs to the dynein light intermediate chain family. {ECO:0000305}.
